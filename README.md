#microview-timed-power
=====================

This project uses the MicroView microcontroller from SparkFun.com.

When running, the user can press a button that will cut off power to the device plugged into the attached PowerSwitch Tail II.  This will automatically set a timer for 15 minutes, at which point the device will get power again.  The user can press the button again to add an additional 15 minutes on the timer.  Holding down the button will disable the timer and return power to the outlet.
